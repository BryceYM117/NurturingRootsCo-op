<h1>Nurturing Roots Co-op Statement of Faith</h1>
<p>We at Nurturing Roots, believe the following:<br>
<b>Scripture:</b>
The Bible is God's written revelation (Psalm 19; 119). It is breathed out by God (2 Timothy 3:16;
2 Peter
1:20-21), and is inerrant (Psalm 119:89; Proverbs 30:5) in the original manuscripts. Scripture is
entirely
sufficient: it teaches, reproves, corrects and trains in righteousness that God’s people may be
complete (1
Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16).<br>
<b>God:</b>
God is holy (Revelation 4:8; 1 Peter 1:16). He is independent (Acts 17:24-25), unchanging
(Numbers 23:19),
eternal (Psalm 90:2), everywhere present (Jeremiah 23:23-24), all powerful (Isaiah. 46:9-10),
and all knowing
(Psalm 139:1-6). He is wise (Proverbs 1:7), and loving (1 John 4:8-10). God, while one, exists in
three distinct
persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:16-20; John 1:1, 14; Acts 5:3-4; Philippians
1:2)<br>
<b>Jesus Christ:</b>
Scripture affirms both the deity and humanity of Jesus Christ. Being man, Jesus had a body and
mind (Luke
2:52; 1 John 1:1-3), and experienced emotions (Matthew 26:38); John 11:35; 13:21). He was
tempted in all
ways (Hebrews 7:26), and victoriously triumphed over temptation (Luke 4:1-12). Jesus’ divinity
is seen in his
being called God (John 1:1-3; Romans 9:5; Philippians 2:5-6; Colossians 1:15-20; Titus 2:13)
and Lord (Luke
2:11; Romans 10:9-13; 1 Peter 3:15). He forgave sin (Mark 2:6-10), demonstrated his
omniscience (Mark 2:8;
John 1:48; John 4:17-18), and omnipotence (Matthew 8:23-34; 14:14-21; John 11:43-44)
Jesus lived a sinless, perfect life, fulfilling the law (Matthew 3:15; 5:17-18; Galatians 4:4-5). He
earned
righteousness (Romans 5:18-19; 8:3-4; Philippians 3:9; Hebrews 5:9). Through his crucifixion,
Jesus became a
propitiation (Isaiah 53:10; Romans 3:25-26; Hebrews 2:17; 1 John 2:2; 4:10). His perfect
righteousness is
credited to those who repent and trust in him, and their sins were placed upon him (2
Corinthians 5:21; 1
Peter 2:22-24). In his resurrection, Jesus triumphed over death and the grave and he now
presently rules from
heaven (Daniel 7:13-14), serving as man’s advocate (1 John 2:1).<br>
<b>The Holy Spirit:</b>
The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal spiritual force. Being the third person of the Trinity, he
speaks (Acts
1:16;8:29;10:19 11:12; 13:2; 28:5); can be lied to (Acts 5:3), can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30),
teaches (John
14:26) and witnesses (John 15:26). He regenerates people (Ezekiel 36:26-27, John 3:5-8),
points believers
towards and glorifies Christ (John 16:7-15), indwells them (Romans 8:11; 1 Corinthians 6:19)
conforms them to
Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18; Galatians 5:16-18), leads in holiness (Romans 8:14; Galatians
5:16-18), gives
assurance (Romans 8:16) and gifts them to build up one another (Romans 12:3-8; 1 Corinthians
12; Ephesians
4:11).<br>
<b>Mankind and Sin:</b>
Of all creation, humanity alone bears God’s image (Genesis 1:26-28; 5:3; 9:6). As such, he is
his unique,
highest creation. Man can reason, feel, and rules the created world as God’s co-regent (Genesis
1:28; 2:19-20;
Psalm 8:6-8). Because of the Fall of Man (Genesis 3:1-19; Romans 5:12-21), every person is
born with a sin
nature (Psalm 14:3; 51:5; 58:3; Ephesians 2:3). Sin has distorted every aspect of man: his heart
(Jeremiah 17:9;
Mark 7:21-23), mind (Romans 1:21; 2 Corinthians 4:4), conscience (Romans 1:17- 18), will
(John 8:34; Romans
8:7) and loves (Isaiah 30:9-10; John 3:19). Every person sins (Psalm 14:3; Ecclesiastes 7:20;
Romans 3:23; 1
John 1:8-10). Because of his sin, man is separated from God (Romans 5:10; 8:7; Ephesians
4:18) and is under
his wrath (Romans 1:18; 2:5). He is in need of a savior.<br>
<b>Salvation:</b>
Before the foundation of the world, based upon his foreknowledge (Romans 8:29; 1 Peter 1:2)
God elected
individuals to salvation (Romans 8:28-30; Ephesians 1:4-7). Because men are dead in their sins
(Ephesians
2:1-3), God initiates and guarantees salvation. He draws individuals to himself (John 6:44; 6:63)
and gives
them life (Ephesians 2:4-10). Regeneration, being born again (John 3:4-8), is his washing of an
individual (1
Corinthians 6:11; Titus 3:5) and giving them a new heart (Ezekiel 36:25-27). Those who are truly
regenerate,
persevere in their faith. Salvation cannot be lost (John 6:39; 10:7-28; Romans 8:29- 30, 38-39).<br>
<b>The Gospel:</b>
Mere belief in the facts of Christ’s work, saves no one (Matthew 7:21-23; 13:1-30, 47-50; John
6:1-71; James
2:14-26). The Gospel call to follow Christ is a call to die to self (Luke 9:23; Galatians 2:20).
Genuine salvation
requires both faith and repentance (Mark 1:14-15; Acts 20:21). Saving faith means to to be
convinced of or to
trust in Christ alone for salvation (Acts 16:31). Repentance means to change one’s
mind—acknowledging that
one is a sinner, and is rightly condemned before a holy God. True repentance is validated in a
changed life
(Luke 3:8-14). To become a Christian is to submit to the lordship of Christ (Romans 10:9), and to
become a
slave of Christ (Ephesians 6:6; 1 Peter 2:16).<br>
<b>The Church:</b>
Jesus Christ founded the church and promised to build it (Matthew 16:13-20; Acts 4:11-12; 1
Corinthians 3:11;
1 Peter 2:6-7). The church officially began at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41). The purposes of the
church are to glorify
God (Ephesians 1:5-6; 3:10-11, 20-21), to edify his people (Ephesians 4:12-16; 1 Corinthians
14:26; 1
Thessalonians 5:11), and to testify his Gospel (Matthew 28:18-20). The marks of a true church
are the right
preaching of the Gospel (1 Timothy 4:13-16; 2 Timothy 4:1-4;) and the proper administration of
the
ordinances: Baptism (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 2:28; Romans 6:3-5; Colossians 2:12) and the
Lord’s Supper
(Matthew 26:26-29; 1 Corinthians 10:17; 11:25-41). The church is led by a plurality of male (1
Corinthians
14:33-35; 1 Timothy 2:11-15) elders (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Titus 1:5).<br>
<b>Sanctification:</b>
The goal for every believer is to become more like Christ (1 Corinthians 11:1; 1 John 2:6).
Increased holiness
flows from union with Christ. (Romans 6:1-14). Genuine Christians will become more like Christ
(Romans 8:29).
God’s grace trains Christians in holiness (1 Timothy 4:7-8; Titus 2:11-13). Sanctification, the
progressive growth
of becoming like Christ, is accomplished by looking at Christ (Romans 13:14; 2 Corinthians
3:18; Colossians
3:10). Sanctification is accomplished by the work of the Christian and the Holy Spirit who gives
both the desire
and means to holiness (Philippians 2:12-13).
Ungodliness, in its essence, is prizing and exchanging pleasure in God for lesser things
(Jeremiah 2:12-13;
Romans 1:18-23). Because Christians are new creatures in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), they
experience true joy
in renewed affections. Life with God is immensely satisfying (Psalm 16:11; 37:4; 42:1-2). God
invites Christians
to find their satisfaction—pleasure, enjoyment, fulfillment—in him (Psalm 34:8; 37:4; Isaiah
55:1-3).<br>
<b>Family:</b>
Marriage is the complimentary union between one man and one woman (Genesis 1:26-27;
2:23-24; Matthew
19:4-6). Husbands are to self sacrificially love their wives (Ephesians 5:25) and gently meet
their needs
(Colossians 3:19; 1 Peter 3:7). Fathers are responsible to lead (1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians
5:23), provide for
(2 Corinthians 12:14; 1 Timothy 5:8), and shepherd their families (Ephesians 6:4). Wives submit
to their
husbands (Ephesians 5:22-24), and manage the home (Proverbs 31; 1 Timothy 5:14; Titus
2:14). Children are
to obey and honor their parents (Ephesians 6:1-2).</p><br>
